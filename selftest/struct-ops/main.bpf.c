 * A simple scheduler.
 *
 * By default, it operates as a simple global weighted vtime scheduler and can
 * be switched to FIFO scheduling. It also demonstrates the following niceties.
 *
 * - Statistics tracking how many tasks are queued to local and global dsq's.
 * - Termination notification for userspace.
 *
 * While very simple, this scheduler should work reasonably well on CPUs with a
 * uniform L3 cache topology. While preemption is not implemented, the fact that
 * the scheduling queue is shared across all CPUs means that whatever is at the
 * front of the queue is likely to be executed fairly quickly given enough
 * number of CPUs. The FIFO scheduling mode may be beneficial to some workloads
 * but comes with the usual problems with FIFO scheduling where saturating
 * threads can easily drown out interactive ones.
